# Context:

The Digital Research Alliance of Canada (the Alliance) seeks to better  understand how Canadian researchers would like to use cloud services (i.e.,  compute and storage) to inform the development of its National Cloud  Strategy. The insights gathered through this survey will serve to identify gaps  in service provision (i.e., equity and accessibility) and improve the  functionality of the Alliance Cloud (i.e., ease of use and navigability). 

The survey was aimed at Canadian researchers (i.e., Professors,  Administrators, Undergraduate/Graduate Students, Post-Doctoral Fellows,  Research Staff or Research Associates), regardless of their level of  engagement with the Alliance Cloud (formerly Compute Canada Cloud) or  other cloud services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or  storage offerings such as Dropbox.

This repository is intended for the analysis of survey results that were collected between January 16th and February 13th, 2023. The survey received responses from over 500 researchers across various academic disciplines in Canada.

A summary of the findings will be shared with the community in Spring 2023.
